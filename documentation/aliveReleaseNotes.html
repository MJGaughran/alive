<h1 align="center">alive Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Pending Release 1-1-0</h2>

<p>Added a field NMVAR to define the environment variable that defines
the IOC's name, with it defaulting to IOC.  I ran into some IOCs that do
weird things with the IOC variable, and this allows one to sidestep
this by defining a different name source.</p>

<p>Added a field IOCNM which shows the IOC name that is sent to the remote
server, as found using the NMVAR field.  This is used for debugging when 
the IOC doesn't send the name you expect to the remote server.</p>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-0-1</h2>

<p>Changed number of ENVxx PV fields from 10 to 16.</p>

<p>Windows build fixes from other BCDA staff added.</p>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-0-0</h2>

<p>This is the first release of the synApps alive module.  It was
developed using EPICS base 3.14.12, but earlier 3.14 releases should
probably work.</p>

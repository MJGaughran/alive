<h2>Record</h2>

<dl>
<dt><a href="aliveRecord.html">aliveRecord.html</a></dt>
<dd>The <b>alive</b> record is used for determining where the
heartbeat information is sent, as well as the extra environment
variables that may be requested remotely.</dd>
<dt><a href="aliveServer.html">aliveServer.html</a></dt>
<dd>This describes how one can implement a server for receiving and
processing the heartbeat meassages, as well as making inquiries to the
alive record about the extra information.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>EPICS Database</h2>

<dl>
<dt>alive.db
<dd>This database is basically a straight implementation of the alive
  record itself.  It creates a record of the name "$(P)alive".
  
  The <strong>RHOST</strong> is defined using "$(RHOST)".  The rest of
  the fields that can be specified have defaults in them that can be
  overridden.  The defaults for "$(RPORT)" and "$(LPORT)" are both
  "5678"; if multiple IOC are to run on the same computer, then the
  "$(LPORT)" values for each IOC should be different.  Only the first
  six of the ten environment variable fields, "$(ENV1)" to "$(ENV10)",
  have defaults, being "ARCH", "TOP", "EPICS_BASE", "SUPPORT",
  "ENGINEER", and "LOCATION".
</dl>


<h2>MEDM display files</h2>


<P>

<dl>
<dt>aliveRecord.adl<br>
<dd>This is the medm ADL file for an alive record.  All the fields are
exposed on this screen.

</dl>

<h2>How to build and use</h2>

<ul>

<li>Edit <code>configure/RELEASE</code> to specify the paths to <b>EPICS
base</b>.  There are no dependencies on any other modules.</li>
<li>Run Gnu Make to build.</li>
<li>Note that the <em>alive</em> module is not useful on its own, as it needs
  a remote server to send heartbeat information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checking to see if record works</h2>

<ul>

<li>Configure an alive record to talk to a remote server daemon that understands how to talk to this type of record..</li>
<li>Make sure that the ISUP field is set to "Off"</li>
<li>Set ITRIG field to "Trigger".  If ITRIG goes back to being "Idle",
then the remote daemon has read the boot information, meaning the
record is successfully talking to the daemon.</li>
</ul>
